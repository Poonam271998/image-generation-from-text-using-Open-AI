# image-generation-from-text-using-Open-AI

Recently, I worked on a project to generate stunning AI-powered images using OpenAI's DALL-E model. With just a simple text prompt, you can create unique visuals that bring ideas to life! 
Hereâ€™s what I accomplished: Prompt: "Junior Data Scientist working with a Senior Data Scientist"
Output: A high-quality image (1024x1024 resolution) tailored to the description.
Tools: Python, OpenAI API, and PIL for image handling.
